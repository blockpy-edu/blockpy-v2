# BlockPy

A modern dual Python editor that combines **Blockly** (visual block-based programming) and **CodeMirror 6** (text editing) with bidirectional synchronization, powered by **Pyodide** for in-browser Python execution.

---

## Project Purpose

BlockPy lets learners write Python code either as visual blocks or as text, with both views staying in sync. This lowers the barrier to learning Python: beginners can start with blocks and gradually transition to text.

### Architectural Boundaries

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|---------------|
| React UI (`components/`) | Rendering only; delegates logic to services |
| `syncController.ts` | Source-of-truth for sync state; no React deps |
| `pythonToBlocks.ts` | Pure function: Python string → Blockly XML |
| `blockToPython.ts` | Pure function: Blockly workspace → Python string |
| `pythonBlocks.ts` | Block schema and toolbox definitions |
| `pyodideRunner.ts` | Pyodide lifecycle; CDN-loaded lazily |

---

## Synchronization Model

The sync flow is bidirectional but **change-source aware**:

```
User edits blocks → blockToPython → update CodeMirror text
User edits text  → (debounced 300ms) → pythonToBlocks → update Blockly workspace
```

Key properties:
- **Debounced**: Text changes wait 300 ms before triggering a parse, preventing lag during typing.
- **Source tracking**: `SyncSource = 'blocks' | 'text' | 'external'` prevents circular updates.
- **Non-destructive fallback**: If text cannot be parsed, the last valid Blockly workspace is preserved.
- **Dirty state**: Tracked in `SyncState.isDirty`.
- **No infinite loops**: `isUpdating` flag in `syncController.ts` gates re-entrant calls.

## Supported Python Subset

### Fully Supported
| Construct | Block Type |
|-----------|-----------|
| Number literals | `py_number` |
| String literals | `py_string` |
| Boolean literals (`True`/`False`) | `py_boolean` |
| `None` | `py_none` |
| Variable references | `py_variable` |
| Assignment (`x = expr`) | `py_assign` |
| Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`) | `py_add`, etc. |
| Comparisons (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`) | `py_compare` |
| Boolean operators (`and`, `or`) | `py_bool_op` |
| `not` | `py_not` |
| `if`/`else` | `py_if` |
| `while` loop | `py_while` |
| `for` loop | `py_for` |
| Function definition | `py_func_def` |
| Function call | `py_func_call` |
| `return` | `py_return` |
| List literal | `py_list` |
| `print(...)` | `py_print` |
| `import` | `py_import` |

### Unsupported Syntax Behavior

When the Python-to-blocks parser encounters syntax it cannot convert:
1. **Parse errors** produce a `py_error` block with the error message.
2. **Unsupported-but-valid syntax** produces a `py_unsupported` block with the raw source.
3. **The last valid workspace is preserved** — unsupported code does NOT overwrite the workspace.
4. Errors are reported in the UI's **Parse Issues** panel with location info (line/col).

Every unsupported node emits a structured `UnsupportedSyntaxError` with:
- `nodeType`: the CST node type name
- `location`: `{ line, col, endLine, endCol }`
- `sourceExcerpt`: up to 60 chars of the offending code

## How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

### Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

### Available Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start Vite dev server |
| `npm run build` | TypeScript compile + Vite production build |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build |
| `npm test` | Run tests once (Vitest) |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint check |
| `npm run format` | Prettier format |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript type check (no emit) |

---

## How to Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Tests use **Vitest** + **React Testing Library** + **jsdom**.

### Test Coverage

| Test File | What It Tests |
|-----------|--------------|
| `blockToPython.test.ts` | Block structures → Python source code |
| `pythonToBlocks.test.ts` | Python source → Blockly XML (all supported constructs) |
| `roundTrip.test.ts` | Round-trip stability: blocks→Python→blocks, Python→blocks→Python |
| `pyodideRunner.test.ts` | Pyodide loader/runner API (mocked) |
| `syncController.test.ts` | Sync logic: debounce, source tracking, no-infinite-loops |
| `BlockPyEditor.test.tsx` | React rendering smoke tests |

Property-based tests (via `fast-check`) cover round-trip stability for numeric and string literals.

Golden-file tests cover representative Python snippets (assignments, if/else, for loops, function defs).

## Browser Support

- Chrome (current stable)
- Firefox (current stable)
- Safari (current stable)
- Edge (current stable)

**Pyodide/WebAssembly limitations**: Pyodide requires SharedArrayBuffer in some modes; the app uses the single-threaded Pyodide build which works without special HTTP headers.

---

## Known Limitations

- `elif` chains are not yet supported (modeled as nested `if/else`).
- Multi-target assignments (`a = b = c`) are not supported.
- Augmented assignments (`+=`, `-=`) are not supported.
- List/dict/tuple comprehensions are not supported.
- `try`/`except` blocks are not supported.
- f-strings produce `py_unsupported` blocks.
- Lambda expressions are not supported.
- Decorator syntax is not supported.
- Comments are not preserved through round-trips (they appear as `py_unsupported` blocks).
- The Blockly workspace state is not persisted between page reloads.

---

## Security

- Python code is executed entirely in-browser via Pyodide's WebAssembly sandbox.
- No code is sent to any external server.
- Execution has a 10-second timeout.
- No telemetry is collected.

---

## Architecture Tradeoffs

1. **CodeMirror parser for Python→Blocks**: We use the actual `@codemirror/lang-python` Lezer parser rather than a custom parser. This is more reliable but means we depend on Lezer's CST node names.

2. **Dynamic Blockly import**: Blockly is lazy-loaded to keep the initial bundle smaller and avoid SSR issues.

3. **Pyodide via CDN**: Pyodide (~7MB) is loaded lazily from jsDelivr only when the user clicks "Run", keeping initial load fast.

4. **Sync debounce**: 300ms debounce on text changes balances responsiveness against parse cost. The last valid block workspace is always preserved on parse failure.

5. **Block schema versioning**: The `PYTHON_BLOCK_TYPES` constant serves as the block schema. Future migrations should use the `py_error`/`py_unsupported` fallback blocks for unknown types.
